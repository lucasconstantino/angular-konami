## Install

As this component is composed of an angular module which contains a directive, to install it you should use whatever package manager you prefer, import *angular-konami.js* to your HTML, and include **konami** as a dependency to your main Angular module.

## Usage

Add the directive *konami* as an attribute to any DOM element you have. The attribute's value should be an Angular expression that will get evaluated when the user types the correct Konami Code. Examples:

```
// Simple counter expression.
<hero konami-code="life++"></hero>

// Scope method expression. For this to work, you must have the function defined to your scope.
<hero konami-code="extraLife()"></hero>
```

### Custom keys

You can also use this directive with custom activating keys. To do that, simply add another attribute to the element called *konami-keys*, passing an array of key codes as it's value. Example:

```
<hero konami-code="hadouken()" konami-keys="[40, 39, 65]"></hero>
```
